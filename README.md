Unfortunetely, I faced the following programming issues that prevented me from running the code:

##### first issue 

PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:

 ##### second issue
 
 ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'conf'
 
 ### Conclusion
 
 Anyway, I adapted the code and uploaded it in the repository. Also, I created /uploaded the empty files that should be delivered.
